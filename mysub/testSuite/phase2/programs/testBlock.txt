Purpose: To test that the parsing of programs is working correctly using the Block rule.
Expected Output: The parser should yield, at the beginning, sProgram, sIdentifier, sParmEnd, and sBegin. At the end, the parser should yield sEnd.
Actual Output (success):
 .sProgram
 % .sNewLine
 .sIdentifier
 .sParmEnd
  .sBegin
   .sAssignmentStmt
   .sIdentifier
        .sIdentifier
   .sExpnEnd
  .sEnd
