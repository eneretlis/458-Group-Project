Purpose: Confirm that the old PT Pascal commenting using { } is no longer supported by Quby.
Expected Output: The scanner should emit an eIllegalChar token for the braces since they are no longer a part of the Quby language. 
The output token “comment” should be saved by the buffer as it is not ignored since it is not properly commented out.
Actual Output (success):
 #eIllegalChar
  .pIdentifier
  % Output token text 'comment'
 #eIllegalChar
 .pNewLine
 .pEndFile
