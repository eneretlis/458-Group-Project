Purpose: Confirm that the scanner no longer accepts := 
Expected Output: Scanner recognizes the colon and equals separately without emitting a pColonEquals token.
Actual Output (fail):
line 787: subscript out of range
 .pColon
 .pEquals
% value emitted 36

Line 321 of ssltrace.t: String passed to "strint" is not in correct format.
.pIdentifier
Notes: The scanner is recognizing the pColon and pEquals but an error is occurring in our code. Will fix in next advisory session.
